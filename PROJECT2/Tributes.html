<p> <strong>Native Cooking: See Why Our Recipes Are Loved by Our Costumer</strong></p>
<hr>

My favorite past time is cooking. I especially enjoy cooking for family and friends. <br>
I was glad to find this website about Native Cooking of Utah. I like to ensure the items I choose to cook meet the needs of my target audience. <br>
The recipes in this collection have been wildly popular with my Utah neighbors and family members. My family especially loves the raspberry cake recipe. I am enclosing a photo of my version of the cake.
My name is Daisy Daniels and I have enjoyed using the recipes I have found at your web site.<br>
I thought I already knew how to cook like a Utahan, but I have been able to expand my repertoire after trying out some of your more unusual offerings.<br>
I like how these recipes are inexpensive to prepare, and they serve lots of people. The clean up usually is painless as well.<br>
I loved your green jello recipe. My family makes sure we never have leftovers when I fix this one.<br>
Thanks for adding spice to my cooking, <br>

Whenever I am at a loss about what to cook for dinner, I just go to your website, and I can always find an answer. <br>

The ingredients in your recipes are always reasonably priced, so I don't have to worry about busting my budget. <br>I was nervous about trying to make my own ice cream, but your Bear Lake Raspberry recipe made me brave enough to try it. 

The step-by-step directions were easy to follow, and my kids really loved the ice cream. I am attaching a photo.<br>

I scream for your ice cream,

Real men are not afraid to try Dutch oven cooking. I made an investment in equipment, but it sat in my garage until I found your wonderful recipes online. <br>

Now, I am a hit at family reunions and campouts. I have tried main dishes, desserts, and even baked rolls. My next attempt will be lasagna. <br>

Thanks for giving me the courage to try cooking the old-fashioned way.  
Warmly yours,
